# Maze Solver

The program solves a maze provided in a .txt file.

The code can be run from the root of the project folder as follows: python3 task.py

The program asks user to provide the file name of the maze (for instance maze1.txt) and a max move number (for instance 20).

After this, the program provides user the result of the solving (False/True) and the final .txt version of the unsolved/solved maze can be found from either solvedMaze.txt or unsolvedMaze.txt.
